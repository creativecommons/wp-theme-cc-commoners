### WordPress Coding Standards

Creative Commons plugin for WordPress follows [WordPress Coding
Standards][standards] and [WordPress Documentation Standards][inline].  Before
pushing your work/contribution, make sure it closely follows these standards
otherwise it will not be accepted. We use a PHP_CodeSniffer setup with
`'WordPress'` sniff to check the code against the standards.

[standards]: https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/

### Recommended Setup for WordPress Coding Standards

If you are not setup to detect WPCS errors, consider the following steps.

1. **Install Composer**

   Make sure that you have the current version of PHP installed. Then the first
   step is to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Install it Globally
   by following its [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
   for your particular OS.

2. **Install PHP_CodeSniffer**

   Install [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) by running the
   following command in your terminal:
   ```shell
   composer global require squizlabs/php_codesniffer
   ```

3. **Confirm Installation**

   Check your installation by `which phpcs`, You should get the path to the
   phpcs executable. If you don't get anything for `which phpcs`, you need to
   add this to your .zshrc or .bash_profile (or your shellâ€™s own profile file)
   so it will make terminal look in that folder too:
   ```shell
   export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   If you are using a Linux distro e.g. Ubuntu add the path below to your
   `.bashrc ` file:
   ```shell
   export PATH="$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"
   ```

4. **Setup WPCS**

   Clone the official [WordPress Coding Standards repository][wpcs-repo] in
   your home folder. To do so, run the following commands:
   if using ssh
   ```shell
   cd
   git clone git@github.com:WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards.git wpcs
   ```
   if using https
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards.git
   ```

5. **Tell PHPCS about this directory**

   We need to add the ~/wpcs folder, where we cloned wpcs, to the installed
   paths of phpcs. Replace the path with the path of your wpcs directory:
   ```shell
   phpcs --config-set installed_paths /Users/your-username/wpcs
   ```

6. **Check Installation**

   Confirm that it is working by running the following command:
   ```shell
   phpcs -i
   ```
   The output should be:
   ```
   The installed coding standards are PEAR, Zend, PSR2, MySource, Squiz, PSR1,
   PSR12, WordPress-VIP, WordPress, WordPress-Extra, WordPress-Docs and
   WordPress-Core
   ```
   If it does not include the WordPress Standards, most probably the
   installed_paths config option is wrong. Make sure that it points to the
   right directory.

7. **Visual Studio Code Workflow**

   To configure VSCode so that it may report errors right in the editor,
   install [phpcs extension][phpcs]. Open User Settings and add the following
   settings:

   ```shell
   "phpcs.executablePath": "/usr/local/bin/phpcs",
   "phpcs.standard": "WordPress"
   ```

   Now, phpcs will report errors inside VSCode. If you are using some other
   editor, consult its documentation. Once there are no reported errors in your
   fix, you are good to go.
